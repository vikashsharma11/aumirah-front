# Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:
Node.js v18.17.0
npm (for package management)
A text editor like Visual Studio Code

## Project Setup
# Clone the Repository: First, clone this repository to your local machine:

### git clone <github url>
Navigate to the Project Directory: Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory:

# Running the Backend
The backend is a Node.js server that handles real-time communication using Socket.io.

Install Dependencies: Install the required Node.js dependencies for the backend using npm or yarn:
### npm install

Start the Backend Server: Start the backend server by running:
### npm start
By default, the backend server will run on http://localhost:4000.

## Running the Frontend
The frontend is a React application where the chatbot interface and homepage are displayed.
Navigate to the Frontend Directory: Go to the frontend directory inside the main project folder:

# Install Dependencies: Install the necessary dependencies for the React app:
### npm install

# Start the React Application: Run the following command to start the React development server:
### npm start
This will start the frontend at http://localhost:3000. The browser should automatically open the app.

Project Overview
Frontend:

Built using React, the frontend handles the user interface for chatting with the bot.
The Chat component shows the chatbox UI and handles the real-time messaging functionality.
The HomePage component contains the homepage layout, including the logo and header.
Styles are applied using CSS for responsiveness and good user experience on different devices.
Backend:

The backend uses Node.js and Socket.io for real-time communication between the user and the bot.
Messages are exchanged between the client (React) and the server, making the chatbot responsive to user inputs.

# Troubleshooting
# Port Conflicts:

If you encounter a port conflict error, it means something is already running on port 3000 (frontend) or port 4000 (backend).
To resolve this:
Stop any running applications on those ports.
Or, change the default port by modifying the package.json scripts or environment variables.
Backend Not Connecting:

Ensure that both the frontend (localhost:3000) and backend (localhost:4000) are running at the same time.
Check the Network Tab in the browser's Developer Tools to ensure messages are being sent and received.
Missing Dependencies:

# If any dependencies are missing or the project fails to start, run the following in both backend and frontend folders:
### npm install
## Cross-Origin Errors (CORS):

If you encounter a CORS error when connecting the frontend and backend, ensure that the backend allows requests from http://localhost:3000 (or your frontend URL). You can update the CORS settings in index.js (backend).
